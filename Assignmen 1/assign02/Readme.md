***Problem With Solution***

1. There is a problem in installing Ubuntu manually. 
2. WSL installation requires new versions which are not available in old version of sudo apt.
3. Also Ubuntu doesn't read all the permissions. Then we run a command "sudo apt get install".
4. Then we go to windows system uninstall program, and active Windows susbsystem for Linux(WSL).
5. Then we install flex by using command "Sudo apt install flex". Because Flex is used in Lexycal Analyzer and we were working in a part of Lexical    analysis.
6. Then we wrote a program in c language. In one file we validate Email addresses and in other file we validate International number.
